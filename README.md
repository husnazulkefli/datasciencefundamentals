## Motivation

The Billboard Hot 100 dataset taken from data.world contains all the list of Hot 100 songs that have been ranked from 1 until 100 weekly. By exploring the Billboard Hot 100 I can identify the most popular songs in the chart, the longest reigning musicians in the chart and also the most featured musicians in the chart. Meanwhile, the Spotify Audio Feature dataset also taken from data.world contains all the data of audio features in a song in Billboard Hot 100. By predicting these attributes, musicians and producers can consider these attributes when composing songs in the future to achieve success in the music industry. Furthermore, musicians can also comprehend how the industry works using these predictions and analysis. However, this prediction is in no way to discourage musicians from making music according to their passion and creativity. The main goal of this analysis is to understand the pattern of the Billboard chart and the potentiality of streaming platforms shaping peopleâ€™s listening habits.
